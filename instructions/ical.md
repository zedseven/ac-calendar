into the "website" or "URL" field of your chosen app.


Unfortunately I can't provide instructions for all of the likely hundreds of different places one could use this, but here are instructions for a few:

* [iCloud/Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202361)
* [Microsoft Outlook Calendar](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-Outlook-com-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c)
* [Thunderbird Calendar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/creating-new-calendars#w_icalendar-ics)

(note that many calendar apps, especially for phones, directly use the calendars added in your phone's settings, so you need only to add it there)
