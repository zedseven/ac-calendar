# Animal Crossing Digital Calendar
A calendar of all Animal Crossing events and birthdays with usable dates.

### Please note: until the dates of more events are known for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, many events are based on AC:NL - this will be updated as more is known

This includes but isn't limited to:
* the birthdays of every villager ever with a known birthday
* seasonal change dates
* celebrated solstices
* fishing tourneys
* bug-offs
* festivals
* toy day celebrations

The birthday events are by far the most numerous, and each one has an attachment with the villager's picture as well as a link to their entry on [nookipedia.com](https://nookipedia.com/) for more information.

In addition, each event has a similar link to be able to read up further.
