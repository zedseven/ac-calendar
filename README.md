# Animal Crossing Digital Calendar

### Please note: until the dates of more events are known for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, many events are based on AC:NL - this will be updated as more is known

This includes but isn't limited to:
* the birthdays of every villager ever with a known birthday
* seasonal change dates
* celebrated solstices
* fishing tourneys
* bug-offs
* festivals
* toy day celebrations

The birthday events are by far the most numerous, and each one has an attachment with the villager's picture as well as a link to their entry on [nookipedia.com](https://nookipedia.com/) for more information.

In addition, each event has a similar link to be able to read up further.

Note that not every Animal Crossing event is marked in the calendar, as not all of them have predictable dates.

## Using the Calendar
This has been created as a Google Calendar - if you use a Google account you can subscribe to it directly, or if you use another calendar app you can add the iCalendar link instead.

### [Detailed Instructions on How to Add It](/instructions)

* **[iCalendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/33pr4f8epfbl7tdf5rqv539ko0%40group.calendar.google.com/private-f4ce1a0d4eb3299a7f82e5f9bb2a0881/basic.ics)**

All data for event dates, scheduling, and birthdays has been sourced from [nookipedia.com](https://nookipedia.com/). If something is incorrect or missing, [open an issue](https://github.com/zedseven/ac-calendar/issues/new) or send me an email.

## A Couple Examples
The calendar is rich with villager birthdays:

> ![A screenshot of Bluebear's birthday on June 24th](/media/birthdayExample.png "Bluebear is one of my favourite villagers, and one of the originals from my first Gamecube town. :)")

Note [the attachment, Bluebear.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15-HFk3OMNb_xrXo8mVoauhou8-ctd1hk/view) - there's one on every birthday so even if you don't recognize the villager by name, you can quickly see if you know them by appearance!


> ![A screenshot of a Fishing Tourney event](/media/fishingTourney.png "Once more is known about AC:NH, fishing tourney events will also have information about whether they're single or multiple-fish ones.")

This is an AC:NL fishing tourney date - it's very likely to be different in AC:NH!


> ![A screenshot of a Fireworks Show, which in AC:NL occurred every sunday in August](/media/fireworksShowExample.png "Setting this up involves modifying the RRULE entries of the calendar through the API or iCal import!")

Some events are impossible to set up through a normal calendar app and had to be set up through the API - not super interesting, but something I'm proud of. Google Calendar doesn't support having an event repeat every *\<day\>* of a single month every year.


All events are set up in such a way that the calendar will continue to be correct for years to come.
